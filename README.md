# QtecLaravelProject
In this project, I have created a custom authentication mechanism for the user. To use Notes, users have to log in to the site; if they don't have any accounts, they must create one to use the feature.

Please follow the steps to run the project on your local device.

1. Install Xamp, Wramp, or any other web server to maintain the database.
2. Go to phpmyadmin on your local server and import the database file "qtecproject.sql" from main branch.
3. Set up a Laravel environment on your device.
4. Download project file from the master branch
5. go to project folder
6. Open the terminal and type the command "php artisan serve" to run the application.
7. Type (your local_address/) to open the first page of the project.
